Task-01: Text-Based Game
Objective: Implement a simple text-based game using conditional statements for game logic.

This task involves creating a basic game that operates through textual interactions. You'll use conditional statements (like if, else if, else) to manage game flow based on player inputs and game state.

Task-02: Number Patterns
Objective: Generate and print simple number patterns using loops.

In this task, you'll utilize loops (such as for or while loops) to generate and display various number patterns. These patterns could include sequences like triangles, squares, or any custom arrangement of numbers.

Task-04: Temperature Converter Program
Objective: Build a temperature converter program for Fahrenheit and Celsius conversions.

This program will enable users to input temperatures in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and convert them to the other unit based on user selection. It should handle conversions accurately using the respective conversion formulas.

Task-05: Enhance CRUD Application with File I/O
Objective: Enhance the CRUD application to store task data persistently using file I/O.

In this enhancement, you'll modify the CRUD application from Task-03 to include file handling functionalities. Implement mechanisms to save the task list to a text file and load it back when the application starts, ensuring persistent storage of task data.
